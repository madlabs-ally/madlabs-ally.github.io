      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever had a moment when you wished there was a tool that could simplify your life and make complex tasks easier? That's exactly what inspired us to create this calculator app. It all began with a personal experience that sparked the idea and ignited our passion for creating something innovative and useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        As individuals pursuing our education at Holberton School, we constantly strive to apply our knowledge and skills to real-world scenarios. This project, however, goes beyond fulfilling academic requirements. It emerged from a shared desire to make a meaningful impact and create a tool that would make calculations effortless and intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The journey of this project started several months ago when we began brainstorming ideas and designing the user interface. We dedicated countless hours to research, development, and testing, driven by our shared vision to create a reliable and user-friendly calculator app.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the app evolved, we faced challenges and obstacles, but we overcame them through collaboration, problem-solving, and continuous improvement. It was a journey filled with learning opportunities, and each step brought us closer to our goal of delivering a high-quality calculator app.
      </p>
      <p>
